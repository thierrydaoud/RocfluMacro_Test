This example shows a shock tube in CMT-nek (branch 'jason' of
https://github.com/dpzwick/Nek5000) coupled with the particle
solver ppiclF (https://github.com/dpzwick/ppiclF).

This is the Mach 1.66 2D, 20% volume fraction version of the case in the paper:

   "Interaction of a planar shock wave with a dense particle 
    curtain: Modeling and experiments" (Ling et al., 2012)
